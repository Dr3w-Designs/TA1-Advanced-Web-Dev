                    As we welcome 2026 with open arms, the Enduro Trail Ubusan community kicked off the year in spectacular fashion. Our first major event of the year brought together riders from across the region, all eager to prove their skills and test their endurance.

                    The Jollibee Strikes event was an exhilarating showcase of determination and grit. Participants navigated challenging terrain, tackled steep inclines, and conquered obstacles that pushed their physical and mental limits. The atmosphere was electric, with riders encouraging one another and celebrating every achievement, no matter how small.

                    What made this event particularly special was the sense of community that permeated every moment. Veterans shared tips with newcomers, friendships were forged on the trails, and everyone left with a renewed commitment to the sport they love. The trails of Ubusan once again proved why they are a premier destination for hard enduro enthusiasts.
