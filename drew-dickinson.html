                <h2>Three Desks Away (But Might As Well Be Everything)</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on December 24, 2025 | By Drew</p>
                
                <p>Emily Dickinson lived a small life in a small town, seeing the same people day after day. Her poetry reveals what many of us discover: that sometimes the most overwhelming love isn't with someone exotic or distant, but with someone you've known casually forever. Someone who was just part of the scenery until suddenly they're the entire landscape.</p>
                
                <p>"Wild nights – Wild nights! / Were I with thee," she wrote about feelings that caught her completely off guard. This wasn't someone she went looking for. This was someone who was just there—at gatherings, at lectures, in her daily routine. But then one day, something shifted. A comment they made. The way they looked at her. And suddenly this familiar person became intoxicating.</p>
                
                <p>What makes Dickinson's poetry so intense is its compression—like how falling for your classmate compresses your world. That room becomes the only room that matters. Those hours become the hours you live for. All the complexity of your life gets focused down to this: will they be there today? Will they sit nearby? Will you find a reason to talk?</p>
                
                <p>"The Heart wants what it wants – or else it does not care," she writes. And your heart wants the person you've been seeing three times a week all semester. The one whose handwriting you recognize. Who borrows your notes. Who makes offhand comments that somehow stick with you for days. You didn't choose this, didn't plan it. Your heart just decided, without consulting you, that this ordinary person is extraordinary.</p>
                
                <p>Dickinson understood the specific torture of proximity without possession. When the person you've fallen for is right there, accessible but not yours. When you share space but not understanding of what that shared space means to you. When you're close enough to notice everything—how they tap their pen when thinking, how they smile at their own jokes—but not close enough to say: you've become my entire world, and you don't even know it.</p>
                
                <p>Her poetry reminds us that love doesn't need distance to be powerful. Sometimes the most consuming feelings are for the person sitting three desks away, living their normal life, completely unaware that they've become someone else's metaphor, someone else's missed call, someone else's wild nights—all in the quiet privacy of an aching heart. —Drew</p>
