                    As 2025 drew to a close, the Enduro Trail Ubusan community gathered for one final celebration—a ride that would serve as the perfect bookend to an incredible year. The "One Last Ride" event brought together veterans and newcomers alike, all united by their passion for hard enduro racing.

                    The trails were in perfect condition, and the weather blessed us with ideal riding conditions. Participants pushed themselves to the limit, knowing this would be their last chance to test their skills before the new year. The energy was palpable, with riders cheering each other on and celebrating personal bests throughout the day.

                    Beyond the racing itself, this event was about reflection and gratitude. Riders took time to appreciate the growth they'd achieved throughout 2025, the friendships forged on these challenging trails, and the memories that would carry them into 2026. It was a reminder that enduro is more than just competition—it's about community, perseverance, and the journey we share together.

                    As we transition into the new year, we carry the spirit of "One Last Ride" with us. The lessons learned, the barriers broken, and the bonds strengthened will serve as our foundation as we embark on new adventures in 2026. Here's to one last ride of 2025, and countless more in the years to come.
