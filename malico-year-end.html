                    Malico's varied landscape presented challenges across multiple disciplines—sustained climbs, technical descents, obstacle navigation, and endurance sections. Riders had to be versatile, switching mindsets and techniques as they transitioned between different terrain types. This variety is what makes Malico such a beloved fixture in the calendar.
