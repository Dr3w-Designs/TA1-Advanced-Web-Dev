                <h2>Home Is a Person (And They've Been Here All Along)</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">Published on December 28, 2025 | By Andres</p>
                
                <p>Mahmoud Darwish spent his life writing about home and belonging. But his poetry also captures something quieter: the discovery that home isn't always a place. Sometimes it's a person. Sometimes it's the classmate whose presence makes any room feel like where you're supposed to be.</p>
                
                <p>"We have on this land what makes life worth living," he writes. But what if the thing that makes life worth living isn't the land, but the person sitting next to you in class? The one whose laugh feels like coming home. The one you didn't seek out but somehow found anyway, right there in the daily routine of shared spaces and ordinary moments.</p>
                
                <p>His poetry speaks to the shock of recognition—when someone you've been seeing every day suddenly becomes someone you can't stop seeing. When you realize you've been memorizing things about them without meaning to. The way they take notes. How they react when they're frustrated. That they always sit in the same spot, and now you find yourself choosing the seat where you can see them.</p>
                
                <p>"I have learned and dismantled all the words in order to draw from them a single word: Home," he writes. And isn't that what happens when you fall for your classmate? All the complex vocabulary you have for different types of connection gets simplified. This person was your study partner, your project collaborator, your casual friend. Now they're just... everything. All those words collapse into one feeling.</p>
                
                <p>Darwish teaches us that love doesn't need to be sought in distant places or dramatic circumstances. Sometimes the person who will make you feel most at home is already sharing your space, already part of your daily life. You just need that moment of clarity where you look at them—really look—and realize they've been exactly what you needed all along, right there in the same room. —Andres</p>
